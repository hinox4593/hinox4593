## Hello there 👋

Signals and communication is a fascinating and creative domain to work in.  
I enjoy exploring this field by building systems from the ground up, focusing on core concepts and fundamental building blocks rather than random or disconnected projects.

This repository is a collection of projects where I apply signal and communication theory through code and experimentation. Each project is designed to strengthen conceptual understanding and practical implementation skills.

### More about me
- Engineering student with a strong interest in signals and communication systems  
- Curious about unconventional communication concepts and human-to-human interaction  
- A creative and enthusiastic communicator who enjoys blending theory with imagination
